# Leaflet-challenge (Visualizing Data with Leaflet)
#### Overview:
> The aim of this assignment is to visualize the earthquake data from United States Geological Survey(USGS).<br>

#### Pre-requisites:
> Update the `config.py` file with the API key from mapbox.com.<br>
> Create the required structure of files(js, css, html).<br>
> I have picked the coordinates,[37.09, -95.71] to be center of the map.

#### Level 1: Basic Visualization:
> - The dataset used is from url: `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson`.<br>
> - A map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.<br>
> - The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size.<br>
> - The depth of the earthquake by color. <br>
> - The popups are included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.<br>
> - The legend provides context for the map data. <br>
